[ISSUE] Rspack with native CSS chokes on relative URLs

# Steps
1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. enjoy the error (I switched to a PNG image from the SVG in the screenshot, just to be sure)

You can switch to `rspack-css-legacy.mjs` in `/themes/theme/_dev/rspack.config.mjs` to have a succesful build.
